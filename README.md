```bash
python -m frozen_lake_dql.main \\
    --load-model path/to/model.pt \\
    --eval-episodes 100 \\
    --render-eval
```

- `-load-model`: Path to the saved model file.
- `-eval-episodes`: Number of episodes to run for evaluation.
- `-render-eval`: Render the environment during evaluation.

## Module Overview

The project is divided into several modules, each responsible for a specific part of the implementation. Below is a high-level explanation of each module and its functionality.

### 1. DQN Model (`models/dqn_model.py`)

This module defines the neural network architecture used by the DQN agent. The `DQN` class inherits from PyTorch's `nn.Module` and represents a feedforward neural network.

- **Input Layer**: Accepts the state representation from the environment. In the Frozen Lake environment, states are one-hot encoded vectors corresponding to the discrete grid positions.
- **Hidden Layer**: A configurable layer that allows you to adjust the network's capacity. It uses the ReLU activation function to introduce non-linearity.
- **Output Layer**: Produces Q-values for each possible action, providing the agent with estimates of the expected rewards for taking each action from the current state.
- **Methods**:
    - `forward()`: Defines the forward pass computation through the network.
    - `save()` and `load()`: Utility functions to persist the model weights for later use.

This modular design allows for easy experimentation with different network architectures by simply adjusting parameters without altering the core codebase.

### 2. DQN Agent (`agents/dqn_agent.py`)

The agent module encapsulates the logic for decision-making and learning from interactions with the environment. The `DQNAgent` class manages several key components:

- **Action Selection**: Implements the epsilon-greedy policy to balance exploration and exploitation. The agent chooses random actions with probability Œµ and the best-known action with probability 1-Œµ.
- **Experience Replay**: Stores past experiences in a replay memory to break the correlation between consecutive samples. This approach stabilizes training by providing the agent with a more diverse training dataset.
- **Network Optimization**: Contains methods to sample batches from the replay memory and perform gradient descent updates on the policy network. It also handles the periodic synchronization of the target network.
- **Attributes**:
    - **Policy Network**: The main network that gets updated every training step.
    - **Target Network**: A copy of the policy network used to calculate target Q-values, updated less frequently to provide stability.
    - **Optimizer and Loss Function**: Configured to update the network weights based on the difference between predicted and target Q-values.

By abstracting these functionalities into the `DQNAgent` class, the code remains organized and focused, making it easier to understand the agent's behavior and learning process.

### 3. Trainer (`training/trainer.py`)

The trainer module is responsible for managing the overall training process. The `FrozenLakeTrainer` class orchestrates the interaction between the agent and the environment.

- **Environment Setup**: Initializes the Gymnasium Frozen Lake environment with specified configurations, such as map size and slipperiness.
- **Training Loop**: Iteratively runs episodes where the agent takes actions, receives rewards, and learns from experiences.
- **Evaluation**: Periodically assesses the agent's performance to monitor progress and adjust training parameters if necessary.
- **Logging and Saving**: Keeps track of important metrics like cumulative rewards and steps per episode. It also handles saving the model weights at specified intervals.

The trainer encapsulates the high-level flow of training, allowing for easy adjustments to the training process and ensuring that the main script remains clean and manageable.

### 4. Utilities (`utils/`)

The utilities package includes helper modules that support the main functionality of the project.

### a. Configuration (`utils/config.py`)

This module defines data classes for storing configuration settings and hyperparameters.

- **`DQNConfig`**: Contains parameters related to the agent and neural network, such as learning rate, discount factor, and network architecture.
- **`TrainingConfig`**: Holds settings for the training process, including the number of episodes, maximum steps per episode, evaluation intervals, and model saving paths.

Using data classes for configuration promotes cleaner code and easier management of parameters across different parts of the project.

### b. Memory Management (`utils/memory.py`)

Implements the experience replay mechanism through the `ReplayMemory` class.

- **Experience Storage**: Uses a deque (double-ended queue) to store experiences as tuples of (state, action, next_state, reward, done).
- **Sampling**: Provides a method to randomly sample batches of experiences for training, which helps in breaking the temporal correlations between experiences.
- **Capacity Management**: Maintains a fixed memory size, automatically discarding the oldest experiences when new ones are added beyond the capacity.

This module ensures that the agent can effectively learn from past experiences while maintaining computational efficiency.

### c. Visualization (`utils/visualization.py`)

Offers functions to visualize the agent's training progress and performance.

- **Training Metrics Plotting**: Generates graphs for rewards and steps per episode, allowing for the analysis of learning trends over time.
- **Q-Value Heatmaps**: Visualizes the learned Q-values for different state-action pairs, providing insights into the agent's decision-making process.
- **Episode Visualization**: Creates detailed plots of states, actions, and rewards within a single episode to examine the agent's behavior.

Visualization tools are essential for diagnosing issues, understanding the learning process, and communicating results effectively.

### 5. Main Script (`main.py`)

The `main.py` script serves as the entry point for running the training and evaluation processes.

- **Argument Parsing**: Utilizes the `argparse` library to allow users to specify training parameters and configurations via command-line arguments.
- **Experiment Management**: Sets up directories for saving models and logs, ensuring that results are organized and reproducible.
- **Training Workflow**: Initializes configurations, creates the trainer and agent instances, and starts the training loop.
- **Exception Handling**: Manages interruptions gracefully, saving the model state if the training is stopped prematurely.
- **Result Visualization**: After training, it calls visualization functions to generate plots and saves them in the designated directories.

By handling the execution flow in `main.py`, the project maintains a clear separation between configuration, execution, and implementation, making it user-friendly and easy to extend.
